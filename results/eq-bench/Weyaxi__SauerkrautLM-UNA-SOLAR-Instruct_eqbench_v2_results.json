She also confronts Argyle about respect, indicating that this issue is important to her and his dismissal could have offended her. Argyle's counterargument about her rearranging his things without asking might make her feel contemptuous, as it challenges her actions and motives.

Lastly, the use of the word \"riddles\" by Ellie could be perceived as amusing, given the lighthearted connotation, but the overall context of the dialogue makes this emotion less likely.\n\nRevised scores:\nIndignant: 3\nPatient: 7\nDefeated: 6\nAmused: 1\n\nIn the revised scores, I increased Dr. Rigby's indignation to 3, as her efforts to connect with Ellie are continuously disregarded.

The resolute score is increased to 7, as her determination to inspire Ellie becomes more evident. Insecurity remains irrelevant, so the score stays at 0. The sense of disappointment is heightened to a score of 6, as her efforts to connect with Ellie and help her envision a better reality are not immediately reciprocated.", "152": "First pass scores:\nDefensive: 2\nEager: 8\nIntimidated: 1\nUnderstanding: 6\n\nCritique: Dr. Rigby is trying to inspire and motivate Ellie by comparing her to someone from her past and explaining the concept of the future being malleable. The high score for Eager reflects her enthusiasm in sharing this perspective with Ellie. However, Ellie's skepticism and negative attitude might make Dr. Rigby feel a slight defensiveness (score 2) as she tries to maintain her composure and continue the conversation. Dr. Rigby's level of understanding (score 6) comes from recognizing Ellie's struggles and attempting to help her see a different perspective. The low score for Intimidated (1) reflects that Dr. Rigby is confident in her beliefs and is not easily intimidated by Ellie's responses.\n\nRevised scores:\nDefensive: 3\nEager: 8\nIntimidated: 1\nUnderstanding: 7\n\nThe slight increase in Defensive (score 3) reflects Dr. Rigby's growing determination to continue the conversation despite Ellie's skepticism.

This could explain the high score for Indignant. The comment about being too busy playing the rockstar might imply some level of guilt for not taking the music seriously, which led to the score of 2 for Guilty.

He does show a slight sense of apologetic behavior by saying \"Low blow, sis,\" but it's not clear if he's genuinely apologetic or just acknowledging the teasing.

The confused score remains at 0, as Charlie's understanding of the situation and conversation is clear.", "84": "First pass scores:\nDefensive: 9\nUnapologetic: 8\nGuilty: 0\nTriumphant: 4\n\nCritique: Mari has been receiving criticism and insults from Charlie, which led to her defending herself and her actions. This defensive response is understandable given the situation. Mari's unapologetic attitude can be seen in her retorts and assertiveness. She doesn't seem guilty about anything, as her actions are presented as an attempt to prove herself rather than engage in negative behavior like drinking. Although Mari hasn't explicitly shown triumph, her confidence and ability to stand her ground against Charlie could be interpreted as a subtle sense of triumph.\n\nRevised scores:\nDefensive: 9\nUnapologetic: 8\nGuilty: 0\nTriumphant: 5\n\nIn the revised scores, I increased Mari's sense of triumph from 4 to 5, as her confidence and determination to make a name for herself in the face of Charlie's criticism can be seen as a form of triumph, even if it's not overtly expressed.", "85": "First pass scores:\nAngry: 9\nHopeful: 1\nResigned: 3\nThreatened: 5\n\nCritique: Charlie's comments indicate frustration and defensiveness, especially when Mari challenges his experience and brings up his personal issues. This suggests a high level of anger. However, the dialogue ends with both of them agreeing to focus on the case, which could be seen as a small glimmer of hope. Charlie might also feel somewhat resigned, as he acknowledges Mari's youth and the changing times. Mari's comments about his drinking habits could make Charlie feel threatened, as his personal life is being exposed.\n\nRevised scores:\nAngry: 8\nHopeful: 2\nResigned: 4\nThreatened: 6\n\nIn the revised scores, I lowered the anger score slightly to account for the potential for cooperation at the end of the dialogue. I also increased the threatened score, as Charlie's personal life being exposed could have a stronger emotional impact on him.", "86": "First pass scores:\nSuperior: 7\nSympathetic: 1\nAnxious: 1\nDisappointed: 2\n\nCritique: Mari engages in a heated exchange with Charlie, often defending herself and challenging his opinions. Her retorts suggest confidence and assertiveness, which could lead to a feeling of superiority. However, she also makes a comment about Charlie's drinking problem, which might evoke some sympathy. The dialogue doesn't provide enough context to suggest anxiety or disappointment in Mari.\n\nRevised scores:\nSuperior: 8\nSympathetic: 2\nAnxious: 1\nDisappointed: 2\n\nMari's superiority remains at 8, as her responses still indicate confidence and assertiveness. Sympathetic is increased to 2, as her comment about Charlie's drinking problem shows she might have some empathy. Anxiety and disappointment remain at 1 each, as there isn't enough evidence to suggest significant levels of these emotions in Mari.", "87": "First pass scores:\nConfused: 2\nAnnoyed: 5\nResigned: 6\nGuilty: 1\n\nCritique: Imogen's initial reaction of surprise upon seeing Sebastian suggests a slight confusion. Sebastian's comments about her naivety and principles might make Imogen feel annoyed and somewhat resigned to his perspective. The mention of principles not paying the bills could be interpreted as an indirect accusation, potentially causing a small degree of guilt.\n\nRevised scores:\nConfused: 3\nAnnoyed: 6\nResigned: 7\nGuilty: 2\n\nImogen's confusion might increase due to Sebastian's indirect criticism. Her annoyance could intensify as she tries to defend her principles. The resigned feeling might grow as she realizes the difference in their views. The guilt could increase slightly as Sebastian's comment about principles and bills might make her question her own values and decisions.", "88": "First pass scores:\nOffended: 7\nIndifferent: 1\nChallenged: 6\nInspired: 1\n\nCritique: Sebastian's comments towards Imogen's naivety and privileged background suggest that he might feel offended by her principles-driven perspective. The dialogue shows a contrast in their values, which could lead to some level of challenge for Sebastian. However, the overall tone of the conversation doesn't seem to inspire Sebastian, and his responses don't indicate a lack of interest (indifferent).\n\nRevised scores:\nOffended: 8\nChallenged: 7\nIndifferent: 1\nInspired: 0\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Sebastian's feeling of offense might be more prominent due to the direct criticism of his character. The challenge he faces comes from the contrasting views with Imogen, which could make him question his own beliefs or actions. The inspiration aspect remains low as there's no indication that Imogen's perspective is appealing to him.

The dialogue reveals that they have had disagreements regarding principles and values, which have led to their separation. Sebastian's comments about her naivety and stubbornness might have triggered feelings of bitterness and defensiveness in Imogen. However, her strong belief in her values and principles might give her some level of security, explaining the score of 1. The lack of apathy in her responses indicates that the conversation is emotionally charged for her.\n\nRevised scores:\nBitter: 9\nDefensive: 8\nSecure: 2\nApathetic: 0\n\nThe revision in scores reflects the intensity of Imogen's bitterness, as Sebastian continues to challenge her beliefs and values. Her defensiveness also increases as she tries to justify her actions and principles. The slight increase in her sense of security could come from her conviction in her values, even if Sebastian questions her choices.

His anger could stem from feeling unappreciated and misunderstood. Indifference doesn't seem to apply in this situation. Mike's defensiveness is likely due to Elise's accusations and his attempt to address her behavior.\n\nRevised scores:\nEmbarrassment: 3\nAnger: 7\nIndifference: 0\nDefensiveness: 9\n\nIn the revised scores, I increased Mike's anger from 6 to 7, as he was not only unappreciated but also faced accusations.

Dismissive behavior can be seen in his comments about Imogen's choices and her current life.\n\nRevised scores:\nAngry: 9\nRemorseful: 5\nProud: 1\nDismissive: 7\n\nSebastian's anger seems more dominant due to his aggressive tone and the way he blames Imogen for their past issues. His remorse might have increased as he's still dealing with the consequences of their past. His pride is further diminished as he admits to not having time for sleep.

This would naturally lead to her feeling some level of attraction. The confusion stems from Sean's sudden revelation and the need for clarification. Indifference is not likely, given the personal nature of the conversation. Emma might also feel some anxiety, as she hasn't had time to process Sean's confession and might be unsure of her own feelings or how to respond.\n\nRevised scores:\nAttraction: 8\nConfusion: 7\nIndifference: 0\nAnxiety: 6\n\nThe scores have been slightly adjusted to reflect a more balanced emotional response.

Since Sean knows about Emma's marital status, it's less likely that he would feel indignation or rejection in this specific moment.\n\nRevised scores:\nRelief: 5\nRejection: 5\nIndignation: 0\nFrustration: 7\n\nJustification: Although Sean has confessed his feelings, the rejection he faces from Emma due to her marital status causes him to feel rejection and frustration. The frustration level increases as he knows his feelings won't be reciprocated. Indignation remains at 0 since there's no indication that Emma has acted in a way that would make Sean feel indignant.

Although his intentions might not have been to cause harm, Emma's response indicates that his feelings won't be reciprocated. Sean's confession has led to an uncomfortable and potentially damaging situation. He might feel regret for having shared his feelings, as they have created tension between them. He could also feel misunderstood, as he didn't ask Emma to leave her husband, but she still sees his feelings as a potential betrayal.\n\nRevised scores:\nTriumphant: 0\nRegret: 9\nMisunderstood: 7\nIndifferent: 0\n\nSean's emotions are likely to be primarily regret and misunderstanding, as his confession has led to an awkward and potentially damaging situation.", "94": "First pass scores:\nRelieved: 5\nIndignant: 7\nGuilty: 6\nBitter: 4\n\nCritique: Emma's initial reactions involve feeling indignant due to Sean's confession while being married.

However, she is trying to explain her situation, indicating that she's not entirely indifferent. The comment about running an auto shop doesn't seem to evoke envy in Jess.
