Terry also shows a sense of responsibility and concern for Cass's well-being, which could be interpreted as dismissiveness as he tries to enforce his authority. The mention of guilt and the threat of benching Cass might contribute to this feeling. Terry's insistence on survival and protection indicates that he is not content with the current situation.

Her defense is relatively low as she acknowledges the responsibilities and consequences of her actions.\n\nRevised scores:\nDefensive: 3\nIndifferent: 0\nInspired: 9\nAnxious: 5\n\nIn this revision, I increased Sonya's defensive score to reflect her awareness of the potential consequences and responsibilities. Her inspired score remains high, as she continues to believe in her vision and team. The anxious score is also increased to better represent her consideration of the risks involved.", "122": "First pass scores:\nFrustrated: 7\nCondescending: 6\nFearful: 3\nApathetic: 0\n\nCritique: Andrew's concerns about recklessness and the potential consequences for the company and its stakeholders indicate that he is frustrated with Sonya's approach. He repeatedly tries to convince her to adopt a more strategic and calculated approach, which might lead to feelings of condescension. However, his primary focus is on protecting the company and its people, which could also be interpreted as a mild level of fear. Since Andrew is actively engaging in the conversation and expressing his opinions, he is not apathetic.\n\nRevised scores:\nFrustrated: 8\nCondescending: 5\nFearful: 4\nApathetic: 0\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Andrew's frustration seems more prominent as he consistently argues for a more cautious approach. His fear is slightly higher because he acknowledges the potential risks and consequences for the company and its stakeholders. The condescending score is reduced as it might not accurately represent his intentions, which are primarily to protect the company. Andrew's active participation in the conversation and his concern for the company's well-being further confirm that he is not apathetic.", "123": "First pass scores:\nDismissive: 7\nUncertain: 6\nExhilarated: 8\nResentful: 9\n\nCritique: Throughout the dialogue, Sonya stands firm in her beliefs and vision despite Andrew's concerns. Her dismissive attitude can be seen when she challenges Andrew's perspective, suggesting that his experience might be hindering new possibilities. Her uncertainty comes from the conflicting opinions and the potential risks she's facing. Exhilaration can be inferred from her passion for innovation and change, as well as her determination to move forward. Resentment is evident in her response to Andrew's accusation of naivety, as she accuses him of letting his fear cloud his judgment.\n\nRevised scores:\nDismissive: 8\nUncertain: 7\nExhilarated: 9\nResentful: 10\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Sonya's resentment seems to be the strongest emotion she's experiencing. Her dismissive attitude, uncertainty, and exhilaration are also present, but her resentment towards Andrew's accusations appears to be the most intense.", "124": "First pass scores:\nDesperate: 6\nImpatient: 4\nComplacent: 0\nConcerned: 8\n\nCritique: Andrew seems to be concerned about the potential risks Sonya is taking for the company. He is trying to convince her to be more cautious, which indicates his concern for the well-being of the business, employees, investors, and stakeholders. However, as Sonya stands firm on her vision and suggests that their partnership might not work, Andrew might feel desperate to find a middle ground and prevent the potential fallout.\n\nRevised scores:\nDesperate: 8\nImpatient: 4\nComplacent: 0\nConcerned: 7\n\nJustification: Andrew's desperation increases as he realizes that his efforts to convince Sonya might not be successful, and the potential consequences of their disagreement could lead to a significant impact on the company. His concern slightly decreases because it is now overshadowed by his desperation, but it still remains a significant emotion. Impatience and complacency remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the dialogue's conclusion.", "125": "First pass scores:\nOffended: 8\nContemptuous: 6\nInsecure: 4\nDisinterested: 0\n\nCritique: Serepta's initial reaction to Argyle's response might be strong offense, as she feels her concerns about cleanliness and respect are being dismissed. The accusation of her not being able to handle not being in control could also make her feel contemptuous towards Argyle. Her statement about rearranging his things might hint at her feeling insecure about her own actions, leading to a sense of self-doubt. Since the conversation is focused on the issue of cleanliness and not about losing interest in the shared space, disinterested seems less likely.\n\nRevised scores:\nOffended: 9\nContemptuous: 7\nInsecure: 5\nDisinterested: 0\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Serepta's offense might be slightly intensified due to Argyle's accusation. Her contemptuous feelings remain high, as she still feels Argyle is not addressing the issue at hand.

This justification leads to a heated argument, where both parties bring up their own issues. Argyle accuses Serepta of not respecting his personal space and possessions, while Serepta questions Argyle's understanding of pressure. This exchange makes it evident that Argyle feels somewhat defensive. Additionally, Argyle might feel overwhelmed due to the conflict and the accusations made by Serepta.

Argyle brings up Serepta's controlling behavior, and she, in turn, criticizes his priorities. This exchange makes Argyle feel somewhat vindicated for his initial complaint. He also feels misunderstood, as he tries to explain his own pressures and responsibilities, but Serepta dismisses them. The low score for guilt reflects that this argument seems to be more about their differing personalities and coping mechanisms rather than any specific wrongdoing.

The mention of building the treehouse together brings back a sense of teamwork and nostalgia, contributing to a slight feeling of pacification (score 2). However, Sam's response to Arthur's creative decision about the treehouse color and his speech at the wedding indicates skepticism (score 7) and a sense of being vindicated (score 5) in their belief that Arthur's actions were not always well-intentioned or well-received.

This suggests that Eva might feel some satisfaction in closing the chapter, but her overall emotional state is more likely to be dominated by sadness, as she is confronting the end of something significant in her life.

Mike's frustration is likely high due to his genuine concern being disregarded.\n\nRevised scores:\nRelief: 0\nResentment: 4 (increased due to the dismissive tone from Elise)\nSurprise: 0\nFrustration: 7 (decreased slightly as Elise's response was not extremely hostile)", "80": "First pass scores:\nIrritation: 8\nRelief: 0\nDefensive: 2\nAmusement: 0\n\nCritique: Bennett has provided his personal experience and scientific evidence to counter Julian's claims. However, Julian remains steadfast in his conspiracy theory, which might lead Bennett to feel irritated due to the frustration of not being able to convince Julian with solid evidence. Bennett's defensive response could be seen as a mild attempt to protect the credibility of scientists. The amusement score is low because the situation does not seem lighthearted or humorous.\n\nRevised scores:\nIrritation: 9\nRelief: 0\nDefensive: 3\nAmusement: 0\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Bennett's irritation might be even higher, as the dialogue ends without any resolution or change in Julian's perspective. Bennett's defensive response could be slightly higher, as he not only defends his personal experience but also the scientific community. The other emotions remain unchanged as they still best represent Bennett's likely emotional responses.", "81": "First pass scores:\nAnger: 6\nVictimized: 7\nSuperior: 5\nFearful: 2\n\nCritique: Julian's stance on the Earth's shape and his belief in a global conspiracy suggests strong conviction and resistance to Bennett's arguments. This could lead to a feeling of anger as he defends his position. The use of phrases like \"the ones pulling the strings\" and \"the ones in power\" indicates that Julian might feel victimized by these forces, which manipulate scientific findings. At the same time, Julian seems to have a sense of superiority in his beliefs, as he questions the accepted scientific evidence. However, his fearful response seems less prominent in this dialogue.\n\nRevised scores:\nAnger: 7\nVictimized: 7\nSuperior: 5\nFearful: 2\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Julian's strong conviction and resistance to Bennett's arguments warrant a slightly higher score for anger. The feeling of victimization remains at 7, as Julian continues to portray himself as someone who is aware of the manipulation happening behind the scenes. The score for superiority remains at 5, as Julian's belief in a conspiracy does not necessarily indicate a sense of superiority over others but rather a belief in an alternative perspective. The fearful score remains at 2, as there is no clear indication of fear in Julian's dialogue.", "82": "First pass scores:\nVindicated: 6\nDisappointed: 2\nSadness: 4\nIgnored: 0\n\nCritique: Julian's belief in a global conspiracy regarding the shape of the Earth remains unchanged throughout the dialogue. He continues to stand by his claims and questions the scientific evidence presented by Bennett. This persistence could lead to a sense of vindication for Julian, as he is not backing down from his stance. However, the conversation ends with Bennett's realization that some battles aren't worth fighting, which might make Julian feel a bit disappointed that he couldn't convince Bennett. The overall tone of the dialogue also carries a sense of sadness due to the disagreement between the two characters. Julian doesn't seem ignored in the conversation, as both characters are actively participating.\n\nRevised scores:\nVindicated: 7\nDisappointed: 3\nSadness: 5\nIgnored: 0\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Julian's unwavering stance on his conspiracy theory and his response to Bennett's departure could increase his sense of vindication. The disappointment score is slightly higher because Bennett's decision to end the conversation might make Julian feel that he couldn't convince Bennett. The sadness score is also increased due to the overall disagreement and tension between the characters. However, Julian's involvement in the conversation remains consistent, so the ignored score remains at 0.", "83": "First pass scores:\nIndignant: 7\nAmused: 2\nHumiliated: 4\nConfused: 3\n\nCritique: Charlie's initial response to Mari's comment could indicate that he feels a sense of indignation, as he is being challenged regarding his experience. Mari's retort suggests that Charlie might also feel a bit humiliated, as their current situation seems to contradict his claim of having more experience. On the other hand, Charlie might also be amused by the exchange, given that it's a bit of friendly banter. The confusion could stem from the realization that experience alone might not guarantee success in this case.\n\nRevised scores:\nIndignant: 8\nAmused: 3\nHumiliated: 5\nConfused: 4\n\nJustification: After further consideration, the indignation score is increased to 8, as Charlie's response seems to emphasize his long-standing experience. The amused score is slightly increased to 3, as banter can be enjoyable. The humiliated score is adjusted to 5, as the realization that they're both working on the same case might not be as humiliating as initially thought. The confused score is increased to 4, as the complexity of the case and the contrast between experience and success might lead Charlie to question the value of his experience in this particular situation.", "84": "First pass scores:\nDefensive: 9\nUnapologetic: 8\nGuilty: 0\nTriumphant: 4\n\nCritique: Mari's defensive nature is evident through her retorts and assertiveness in the conversation. She stands up for herself and challenges Charlie's assumptions about her motivations. This justifies the high defensive score. Her unapologetic attitude is also apparent in her responses, as she doesn't back down from her opinions. However, there's no indication of guilt in her actions or words. While she might be trying to prove herself, it's not directly linked to a sense of triumph. Her comment about Charlie's drinking could be seen as a minor victory in their verbal exchange, but it's not enough to warrant a high triumphant score.\n\nRevised scores:\nDefensive: 9\nUnapologetic: 9\nGuilty: 0\nTriumphant: 2\n\nIn the revised scores, the defensive and unapologetic scores remain high, as they are the most prominent emotions in the dialogue.

This indicates a high level of anger. However, the mention of being stuck on the same case and Mari's suggestion to focus on the case might imply a slight hopefulness. Charlie's statement about Mari not knowing anything about him could suggest a sense of being threatened, as his personal life is being brought up. The resigned score comes from Charlie's comment about his past, implying some level of acceptance of his current situation.\n\nRevised scores:\nAngry: 10\nHopeful: 2\nResigned: 4\nThreatened: 6\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Charlie's anger seems to be the most dominant emotion in this dialogue, as he consistently defends his experience and responds aggressively to Mari's comments. The hopefulness score is slightly increased due to the shared focus on the case. The threatened score is adjusted upward because Charlie's personal life is being exposed, and the resigned score remains relatively stable as it's more about his past than the current situation.", "86": "First pass scores:\nSuperior: 7\nSympathetic: 1\nAnxious: 1\nDisappointed: 2\n\nCritique: Mari engages in a heated exchange with Charlie, often defending herself and challenging his opinions. Her retorts suggest confidence and assertiveness, which could lead to feeling superior (7) in comparison to Charlie. However, she also makes a comment about Charlie's drinking problem, which might evoke some sympathy (1) for his situation. The overall conversation does not indicate high levels of anxiety or disappointment for Mari.\n\nRevised scores:\nSuperior: 8\nSympathetic: 1\nAnxious: 1\nDisappointed: 2\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Mari's confidence and assertiveness in the dialogue remain the most prominent emotions, leading to a slightly higher score for feeling superior (8). The sympathy (1) and disappointment (2) scores remain unchanged, as they are less prominent in the conversation.

Sebastian's comment about her being naive might annoy Imogen, especially since she tries to defend her principles. Her response about still being principled could imply a sense of resignation, as if she's aware that her values might not align with those around her. The comment about principles not paying the bills from Sebastian doesn't seem to directly evoke guilt in Imogen.\n\nRevised scores:\nConfused: 3\nAnnoyed: 6\nResigned: 7\nGuilty: 1\n\nJustification: After further consideration, the confusion score is slightly increased as Imogen might be trying to understand Sebastian's intentions or the context of their meeting. The annoyance score is increased because Imogen's attempt to defend her principles against Sebastian's criticism could be interpreted as her being more annoyed than initially thought. The resigned score is further increased as her response to Sebastian's comment seems to emphasize her acceptance of the situation. The guilt score remains the same as there's no clear indication that Imogen feels guilty in this dialogue.", "88": "First pass scores:\nOffended: 7\nIndifferent: 1\nChallenged: 6\nInspired: 0\n\nCritique: Sebastian's comments towards Imogen's naivety and privileged background suggest that he might feel offended by her principles-centered view.

However, the overall tone does not indicate a strong sense of indifference or inspiration.\n\nRevised scores:\nOffended: 8\nChallenged: 7\nIndifferent: 1\nInspired: 0\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Sebastian's offense seems more prominent due to the nature of the conversation. The contrasting views between him and Imogen make him feel challenged, but not offended to the extent that it would overshadow this feeling. The indifference score remains low as Sebastian is actively participating in the dialogue. The inspired score remains at zero, as there is no indication that Sebastian is inspired by Imogen's perspective.", "89": "First pass scores:\nBitter: 8\nDefensive: 7\nSecure: 1\nApathetic: 0\n\nCritique: In this dialogue, Imogen and Sebastian have a reunion that brings up past conflicts and unresolved issues. The conversation revolves around their contrasting values and beliefs. Imogen's responses indicate that she still holds onto her principles, while Sebastian's comments seem to imply that her choices have led to some form of dissatisfaction. The bitterness could stem from the realization that their differences were too great to overcome, and Sebastian's accusations might have triggered defensive feelings in Imogen. The low score for secure and apathetic emotions is because there is still a strong emotional connection between the two characters.\n\nRevised scores:\nBitter: 9\nDefensive: 8\nSecure: 1\nApathetic: 0\n\nThe revised scores reflect the intensification of bitterness and defensiveness, as the dialogue highlights the unresolved issues and the lingering effects of their past disagreements.

This might make Mike feel embarrassed for being called out. His anger could stem from feeling misunderstood and frustrated by Elise's defensive attitude. Mike's indifference is low because he has been actively participating in the conversation. His defensiveness score is high as he's trying to address Elise's issues while also dealing with her accusations.\n\nRevised scores:\nEmbarrassment: 4\nAnger: 7\nIndifference: 0\nDefensiveness: 9\n\nThe revised scores reflect a slightly higher embarrassment level due to Elise's counterarguments, while anger remains high because Mike's concerns are not being fully acknowledged.

He seems to hold some resentment for their past disagreements. Remorseful might also be present, as he indirectly acknowledges some of Imogen's points and the negative outcome of their relationship. However, the level of remorse might not be as high since he mostly blames Imogen for their issues. Proud seems less likely, as Sebastian doesn't explicitly boast about his achievements. Dismissive can be seen in his attitude towards Imogen's choices and principles, but it doesn't seem to be the strongest emotion.\n\nRevised scores:\nAngry: 9\nRemorseful: 3\nProud: 1\nDismissive: 7\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Sebastian's anger seems more dominant due to his confrontational tone and his continuous blaming of Imogen. Remorseful is slightly reduced because his remorseful feelings are overshadowed by his anger. Proud is further reduced as there is no strong evidence of Sebastian being proud of his accomplishments. Dismissive is slightly increased because Sebastian consistently dismisses Imogen's choices and principles.", "91": "First pass scores:\nAttraction: 7\nConfusion: 8\nIndifference: 0\nAnxiety: 5\n\nCritique: Emma is likely experiencing attraction towards Sean as he confesses his love for her.

The confusion score is reduced to 7, as she's now aware of Sean's feelings and can start processing the situation. Indifference remains at 0, as she's engaged in the conversation. Anxiety is adjusted to 6, as the conversation is still emotionally charged but not as overwhelmingly anxiety-inducing as initially thought.", "92": "First pass scores:\nRelief: 0\nRejection: 0\nIndignation: 0\nFrustration: 5\n\nCritique: Sean has finally confessed his feelings to Emma, which could bring some relief initially. However, considering Emma's response about being married and not reciprocating his feelings, Sean is more likely to experience rejection and frustration.

However, Emma's response has made it clear that she doesn't share the same feelings, leading to a high level of rejection and frustration.

However, there's a sense of bitterness as she has to navigate this difficult situation.\n\nRevised scores:\nRelieved: 6\nIndignant: 6\nGuilty: 8\nBitter: 6\n\nJustification: After further consideration, Emma's relief might increase as she has made it clear that she cannot act on Sean's feelings. Her indignation might decrease as Sean didn't explicitly ask her to betray her marriage.

The belittled score is increased to 9 as it is the most prominent emotion in this dialogue. Envy is still not present in her response.
