Your task is to predict the likely emotional responses of a character in this dialogue:

Robert: Claudia, you've always been the idealist. But let's be practical for once, shall we?
Claudia: Practicality, according to you, means bulldozing everything in sight.
Robert: It's called progress, Claudia. It's how the world works.
Claudia: Not my world, Robert.
Robert: Your world? You mean this...this sanctuary of yours?
Claudia: It's more than a sanctuary. It's a testament to our parents' love for nature.
[End dialogue]

At the end of this dialogue, Robert would feel...
Remorseful
Indifferent
Affectionate
Annoyed

Give each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.

You must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:

Remorseful: <score>
Indifferent: <score>
Affectionate: <score>
Annoyed: <score>


[End of answer]

Remember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.
