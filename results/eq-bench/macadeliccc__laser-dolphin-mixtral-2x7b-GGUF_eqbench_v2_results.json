However, the dialogue doesn't show a strong indication of him being indifferent, challenged, or inspired. The score for indifference is low because Sebastian does engage in the conversation, and the score for challenge is moderate because he is responding to Imogen's statements.

Anxiety is moderate as she may be feeling nervous or worried about the future of their relationship.\n\nRevised scores:\nAttraction: 6\nConfusion: 8\nIndifference: 1\nAnxiety: 6\n\nThe attraction score is slightly increased as it's more likely that Emma would feel some level of attraction given the context.
