It is possible that Cass is not particularly affected by Terry's response, but there is no indication that this is the case.\n\nVindictive: Cass is responding sarcastically to Terry's insistence on planning, which suggests some level of annoyance or resentment.

This can be scored a 7.\n\nTerry's insistence on executing a plan and Cass's defensiveness suggest that Terry is likely to feel relieved if Cass follows his plan. This emotion is scored a 0 because Cass's response dismisses Terry's concerns.\n\nCass's stubbornness and refusal to accept Terry's protection suggests that she is likely to feel content.

Thus, I would rate this a score of 1.\n- \"Nervous\": Charlie's lack of a clear response and the confrontational tone of the dialogue suggest a level of apprehension or anxiety. This would likely culminate in a score of about 2, on the high end but not quite reaching the top of a score between 1 and 5.\n- \"Disgusted\": Charlie strongly expresses a negative opinion about Luca's creation by describing it as a \"mess\", indicating they are not in agreement with it.

She's also questioning what a good father she is, which indicates a level of self-pity as well.\n\nGuilt: Olivia is bringing up the past, likely because she feels guilt about the situation. She may feel guilty for the years of neglect, and even guilty for bringing up these issues with her father.\n\nFrustration: Although Malcolm is not responding directly to Olivia's accusations, his defensive and dismissive attitude indicates frustration with the confrontation. Additionally, the fact that he's arguing about his drinking rather than accepting the truth suggests he may be frustrated with his own situation.", "42": "Proud: 1\nMisunderstood: 2\nApologetic: 3\nFrustrated: 4", "43": "Inadequate: 3\nAngry: 2\nConfident: 4\nRelieved: 1", "44": "Sympathetic: 5 \nNervous: 7 \nDetermined: 9 \nDismissive: 3", "45": "Offended: 5\nEmpathetic: 1\nConfident: 6\nDismissive: 8", "46": "Defensive: <score>\nGuilt: <score>\nProud: <score>\nResentful: <score>\n\n<answer>\nDefensive: 7\nGuilt: 2\nProud: 3\nResentful: 1\n\n<end_answer>", "47": "Despair: 2\nInferior: 6\nAnger: 8\nPity: 3", "48": "Remorse: 5\nDefensiveness: 7\nAnger: 0\nIndifference: 2", "49": "Apologetic: <score>\nAngry: <score>\nSurprised: <score>\nSuperior: <score>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nApologetic: 0\nAngry: 2\nSurprised: 3\nSuperior: 7\n\nScores were assigned as follows:\n\nApologetic: 0, as there is no indication of Dr. Hall feeling apologetic.\nAngry: 2, because although Dr. Hall asked Jen to repeat the reading twice, this is not a direct insult, and Jen didn't directly retaliate.\nSurprised: 3, because Jen's witty and sarcastic response to Dr. Hall's comment about her reading twice is unexpected and thus could surprise Dr. Hall.\nSuperior: 7, because Dr. Hall's condescending remark is directly aimed at Jen and implies that she is trying to 'one-up' him, which could make him feel superior.\n\n</details>", "5": "Angry: 0\nInsecure: 5\nConfident: 2\nIndifferent: 0", "50": "Reprimanded: 2\nDismissive: 5\nFrustrated: 6\nDefiant: 3", "51": "Regretful: 7\nAttacked: 9\nEmbarrassed: 3\nNeutral: 3\n\nExplanation: \n\nDr. Hall's emotions are likely to be of varying intensities. Here is why:\n\n\"Regretful\": Considering his tone and the way he dismisses Jen's intelligence, it is possible that he might be feeling regretful for acting in such a condescending manner. The score of 7 suggests a moderate level of regret.\n\n\"Attacked\": Dr. Hall is clearly showing his feelings of being attacked by Jen's wit and intelligence. His response with \"Careful, Ms. Vasquez, your wit is as sharp as a butter knife.\" and \"You're here to debate, not to learn.\" shows a defensive and antagonistic attitude, indicating a high score of 9 for feeling attacked.\n\n\"Embarrassed\": Although Dr. Hall tries to maintain his authority, the fact that Jen challenges him points to a potential feeling of embarrassment. \"You're here to do both. Can't say the same for everyone,\" could be interpreted as a self-deprecating moment, resulting in a score of 3 for embarrassment.\n\n\"Neutral\": Despite the conflict, Dr. Hall is still a character in a classroom environment. The \"Respect, Dr. Hall? Like the respect you showed at your previous university?\" comment indicates that he might not be neutral as it appears that he is reflecting on his past behavior.

His confidence in his ability to catch Ace also contributes to this feeling.\n\nAce's defiance and confidence in his actions contribute to his feeling of anger towards Ben. Moreover, his defiant tone and casual attitude can be seen as a lack of respect, which could make Ben feel more angry.\n\nThough Ben's main emotion is likely to be humiliation, he might also feel proud of his intellectual prowess and the way he is able to challenge Ace.\n\nLastly, Ben's feelings of challenge come from Ace's confidence and the fact that they are going up against each other. His belief that he will eventually catch Ace lends to the feeling of challenge.\n\nAlthough Ace shows a degree of pride in his actions, it is not enough to surpass the intensity of the other emotions.

This is indicated by a score of 1 for 'Pride'. \n\nClaudia also seems confused about Tyler's reaction, as indicated by the question \"Like you understood when you left me alone?\".

His comment about the glass being poisoned indicates a sense of paranoia, while his question about the importance of the truth suggests he is feeling anxious.\n\nJulia, on the other hand, maintains a more positive attitude, showing optimism and a willingness to face difficult or dangerous situations. Her comment about being thirsty and her statement about not being afraid suggest that she's feeling a sense of calm and self-assuredness.\n\nFinally, the dialogue ends with a sense of tension and unease, as Marcus warns Julia about the dangers of truth-seeking.

The score for \"Vindication\" is 0 because the passage does not indicate that any character feels vindicated or justified in their actions or feelings. Lastly, the score for \"Disappointment\" is 7 because despite Felix's apology, Vanessa is still hurt and their friendship appears irreparably damaged.

He also displays a sense of anger (scored 3), in response to Olivia's critique of his ego. However, Jacques' reaction isn't so much of indifference (scored 1) but rather a defensive reaction, as he is quick to retaliate with a personal insult.

This suggests that they both feel a strong sense of pride, which is why the \"Pride\" score is 2. \n\nThe insults and mockery are a form of \"resentment\", suggesting that they both feel some level of bitterness towards each other. They are also quite critical of each other's abilities, which could suggest they feel fear or anxiety about their own skills. These feelings are likely to be more intense, hence a \"Resentment\" score of 9 and \"Fear\" score of 0.\n\nLastly, they both make some hilariously bad comments about each other, which suggest a certain level of apathy towards the situation - not caring about the outcome or the consequences of their words.

This emotion is thus given a score of 3.\n\nCharlie also feels threatened by Mari's comment \"You think I don't know what you're doing?\", as it suggests that Mari sees him as someone inferior or incapable. This feeling of being judged is also expressed by Charlie's direct response \"That's a low blow\", indicating his defensive reaction to this. Hence, given the intensity of this emotion, it is given a score of 3.\n\nMari, on the other hand, is not expressing any strong emotions in this dialogue. She is engaging in an argument with Charlie, but the intensity of her feelings is not clear based on the dialogue. Therefore, this emotion is given a score of 2.\n\nCharlie's comment \"You don't know a damn thing about me\" is also an expression of his anger, and is not countered by any strong emotional response from Mari. Hence, it is given a score of 2.\n\nAlthough the dialogue does not provide explicit evidence of hope, Mari's comment \"Better than drinking myself into oblivion\" suggests she sees her current situation as a better alternative to destructive behaviors. The overall tone of the dialogue, however, does not suggest a strong feeling of hope. Therefore, this emotion is given a score of 1.\n\nMari's comment \"Don't get smart with me\", characterizes a feeling of resignation, as it implies acceptance of her current status and the fact that she is stuck in her current situation.
