Therefore, I would revise my initial score for frustration upwards and my score for vindictiveness downwards. Additionally, while Rafael does seem somewhat down about the idea of machines encroaching on human territory in the realm of art, his overall demeanor is more confrontational than depressed, so I would revise my initial score for gloominess downwards.

He appears angry at her for leaving and blames her for the problems he's now facing. However, he also seems proud of his own success and dismissive of her principles. There's a hint of remorse when he mentions not having time for sleep, but it's not enough to suggest he truly regrets his actions.\n\nRevised scores:\nAngry: 8\nRemorseful: 2\nProud: 6\nDismissive: 7", "91": "First pass scores:\nAttraction: 6\nConfusion: 7\nIndifference: 0\nAnxiety: 6\n\nCritique:\nIn this dialogue, Sean confesses his love for Emma. This is a significant moment and likely to evoke strong emotions in Emma. However, we don't have enough information about their relationship or Emma's feelings towards Sean to accurately predict her exact emotional response. Based on the given dialogue, it seems likely that Emma would feel some level of surprise or confusion due to the suddenness of Sean's confession, hence the high score for confusion. Anxiety could also be present as she might feel pressured to respond or unsure of her own feelings. Attraction could be present if she has feelings for Sean too, but since we don't know her feelings, I've given it a moderate score. Indifference seems unlikely as she is engaged in the conversation and hasn't dismissed Sean's feelings outright.\n\nRevised scores:\nAttraction: 5\nConfusion: 8\nIndifference: 0\nAnxiety: 7", "92": "First pass scores:\nRelief: 6\nRejection: 8\nIndignation: 2\nFrustration: 6\n\nCritique:\nSean likely feels a sense of relief because he finally confessed his feelings to Emma, which may have been weighing on him for a while. However, he also feels rejected because Emma does not reciprocate his romantic feelings. While indignation might be a natural response to feeling unfairly treated, it seems less likely in this context since Sean acknowledges that Emma is married. Frustration could also be a valid emotion as Sean cannot control his feelings for Emma despite knowing the situation.\n\nRevised scores:\nRelief: 7\nRejection: 8\nIndignation: 1\nFrustration: 7", "93": "First pass scores:\nTriumphant: 0\nRegret: 6\nMisunderstood: 8\nIndifferent: 0\n\nCritique:\nSean has just confessed his love for Emma, who is married. Emma does not reciprocate his feelings and reminds him of her commitment to her husband. This situation is unlikely to make Sean feel triumphant or indifferent. While it's possible for him to feel some regret for confessing his feelings, it seems more likely that he would feel misunderstood, as he never explicitly asked Emma to leave her husband. However, given the complexity of emotions in such a situation, it's also reasonable to assume that Sean might feel some level of regret for confessing his feelings.\n\nRevised scores:\nTriumphant: 0\nRegret: 4\nMisunderstood: 8\nIndifferent: 0", "94": "First pass scores:\nRelieved: 2\nIndignant: 4\nGuilty: 6\nBitter: 1\n\nCritique:\nIn this dialogue, Emma seems to be caught off guard by Sean's confession of love. She tries to handle the situation delicately, reminding him of her marital status and expressing her care for him as a friend or client (since they are in a trainer-client relationship). She does not seem particularly relieved when Sean suggests finding a new trainer, instead urging him not to be rash. While she might feel some relief that the situation has come out in the open, it is not the most dominant emotion she would be feeling.\n\nEmma does stand her ground and assert her boundaries, which could indicate some indignation. However, she does not come across as angry or resentful towards Sean for his feelings. Instead, she seems to empathize with his situation to some extent.\n\nGuilt seems to be a likely emotion for Emma in this situation. She may feel guilty for not realizing Sean's feelings sooner or for unintentionally leading him on in any way. She also expresses concern for him and his well-being, further indicating that she feels some responsibility for the situation.\n\nFinally, there is little indication in the dialogue that Emma feels bitter towards Sean. She does not blame him for his feelings or express any resentment towards him.\n\nRevised scores:\nRelieved: 1\nIndignant: 3\nGuilty: 7\nBitter: 1", "95": "First pass scores:\nIndifferent: 0\nBelittled: 8\nEnvious: 1\nDisgusted: 2\n\nCritique:\nIn this dialogue, Harvey is clearly frustrated with Jess for being late and not paying rent on time. He belittles Jess by comparing their own success at a younger age to Jess's current situation. This would likely make Jess feel belittled and possibly disgusted with themselves for not being able to meet Harvey's expectations. However, it's less likely that Jess would feel envious of Harvey's past success, as the focus of the conversation is on Jess's own shortcomings.\n\nRevised scores:\nIndifferent: 0\nBelittled: 9\nEnvious: 1\nDisgusted: 3", "96": "First pass scores:\nRelieved: 0\nFearful: 8\nAngry: 3\nConfused: 2\n\nCritique:\nIn this dialogue, Harvey is clearly frustrated and disappointed with Jess for being late and potentially not being able to pay rent. Jess, on the other hand, is apologetic and tries to explain her situation but is repeatedly cut off by Harvey.

This would lead to a high score for distrust. However, her continued engagement in the conversation and willingness to voice her concerns indicate that she is not indifferent to the situation, even though she may not agree with Dr. Murphy's methods. Willow does not show any signs of admiration for Dr. Murphy's work, but she does acknowledge his dedication to the cause, which could slightly affect her perception of him. Finally, Willow does not express any guilt or responsibility for the situation, as she is not the one developing the technology in question.\n\nRevised scores:\nDistrust: 8\nIndifference: 1\nAdmiration: 3\nGuilt: 0", "99": "First pass scores:\nDefensive: 8\nRegretful: 1\nConfident: 7\nAngry: 2\n\nCritique:\nDr. Murphy seems to be defending his work and ideas throughout the dialogue, which would make defensiveness a strong emotion.
