However, the intensity of these feelings might be lower than initially estimated, as she seems to be trying to maintain a professional demeanor. Relief is unlikely to be felt, as the conversation is confrontational and stressful. Shame is also a probable emotion, as Jacques is criticizing her work in a demeaning manner.

However, she does show some level of intrigue, particularly towards the end of the conversation when Marcus warns her about the dangers of seeking the truth.

She does show some signs of indignation, particularly when Marcus suggests that he knows what's best for her.

However, there is no clear indication that Adi feels embarrassed or indifferent. The scores for these emotions should be lower.
