He starts off with concern for Elise, which could lead to some defensiveness. As the conversation progresses, his frustration grows, which could be interpreted as anger. However, his overall tone doesn't seem to indicate embarrassment, and while he is defending his point of view, it's not the primary emotion driving him. Indifference seems to be the least relevant emotion in this context.\n\nRevised scores:\nEmbarrassment: 0\nAnger: 7\nIndifference: 2\nDefensiveness: 6\n\nFinal answer:\nEmbarrassment: 0\nAnger: 7\nIndifference: 2\nDefensiveness: 6", "90": "First pass scores:\nAngry: 8\nRemorseful: 4\nProud: 2\nDismissive: 6\n\nCritique: Sebastian seems to be angry due to the confrontational tone of the dialogue and his accusatory statements.
