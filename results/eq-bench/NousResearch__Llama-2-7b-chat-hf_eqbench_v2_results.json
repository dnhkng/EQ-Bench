However, her humility is evident in her willingness to admit that she made a mistake and offer to pay Harvey as soon as possible.

She seems to be questioning his motives and the ethical implications of the technology he is developing. Her distrust and indifference towards Dr. Murphy are likely rooted in her concerns about the potential risks and her belief that he is not considering the long-term consequences of his actions. Her admiration for Dr. Murphy is muted, as she seems to be struggling to reconcile her admiration for his intelligence and expertise with her concerns about the technology he is developing. Finally, her guilt stems from her belief that she may be complicit in the potential destruction of the planet if she does not speak out against Dr. Murphy's actions.\n\nRevised scores:\n\nDistrust: 7\nIndifference: 4\nAdmiration: 1\nGuilt: 7\n\nIn revising my scores, I have taken into account the nuances of Willow's emotional state and the complexity of her relationship with Dr. Murphy.
