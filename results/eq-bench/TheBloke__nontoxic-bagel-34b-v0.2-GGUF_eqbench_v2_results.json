The feeling of relief is unlikely as he has not been absolved of his actions. The feeling of vindication is also unlikely as he is not feeling justified in his actions. The feeling of despair is high as he is facing the consequences of his actions and the loss of a relationship.

She is not reacting defensively, but rather she is assertively sharing her news. The score for Joy is low because the dialogue doesn't express her joy, but it's possible she feels some happiness about her new relationship. The score for Guilt is high because of the mention of guilt, but the dialogue doesn't provide enough context to justify a high score.

However, the feeling of vindication might be overstated because the dialogue does not end with Bennett agreeing with Julian. The feeling of disappointment might be understated because Julian is likely disappointed that Bennett is not accepting his claims. The feeling of sadness is unlikely because the dialogue does not indicate any sadness.
