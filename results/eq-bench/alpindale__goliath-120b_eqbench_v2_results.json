He doesn't show any signs of remorse or pride in their past actions, but rather comes across as dismissive of Imogen's choices and achievements. However, upon closer inspection, there might be a hint of pride in his voice when he says \"I don't have time for sleep. I'm too busy fixing the mess you left.\" This could be interpreted as a backhanded compliment, implying that only he is capable of cleaning up after her.\n\nRevised scores:\nAngry: 7\nRemorseful: 1\nProud: 3\nDismissive: 8", "91": "First pass scores:\nAttraction: 3\nConfusion: 7\nIndifference: 1\nAnxiety: 9\n\nCritique:\nSean's confession of love for Emma caught her off guard, which would likely evoke a strong emotional response from her.

The dialogue doesn't provide enough information to determine if she reciprocates his feelings.

However, Emma's response is not what he had hoped for. She cares about him but not in the way he wants her to. This would understandably lead to feelings of rejection (8) as his romantic feelings are not reciprocated. There might also be some frustration (3) that he didn't pick up on her cues earlier or that he couldn't control his feelings.
