The score for indifferent is 3, which means that Jess is likely feeling indifferent towards the situation. The score for belittled is 6, which means that Jess is likely feeling belittled by Harvey's comments. The score for envious is 4, which means that Jess is likely feeling envious of Harvey's success.
