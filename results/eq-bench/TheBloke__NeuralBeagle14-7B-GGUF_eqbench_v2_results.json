Envious (3) could be considered to a lesser extent, as Harvey mentions his accomplishments at a younger age, but it's not clear that Jess would feel envious of that specifically.

However, she still maintains that she needs more time, which might give a slight hint of relief that she's at least communicating her need.

The desperation score remains high as she is clearly concerned about the possibility of eviction and her inability to pay rent immediately. The humility score could also be slightly lower as she is not overtly expressing humility in the same way as she does in earlier parts of the conversation.
