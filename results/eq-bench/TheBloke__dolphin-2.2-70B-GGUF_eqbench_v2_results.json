This suggests that he feels vindicated because he believes he has won the argument. However, it's also possible that Julian feels disappointed since he wanted to convince Bennett but failed to do so. There might be a hint of sadness as well, as Julian realizes that despite their friendship, they cannot agree on this matter. Finally, Julian could feel ignored since Bennett decided to end the conversation without fully addressing his points.\n\nRevised scores:\nVindicated: 8\nDisappointed: 4\nSadness: 3\nIgnored: 7", "83": "First pass scores:\nIndignant: 8\nAmused: 1\nHumiliated: 2\nConfused: 0\n\nCritique:\nIn the dialogue, Charlie seems to be defensive and somewhat dismissive of Mari's comment about his experience not being everything.

He is clearly frustrated with Mari's attitude and her lack of respect for his experience. This leads me to believe that he is feeling angry. However, there are moments where he seems resigned to the fact that they have to work together, which could indicate some resignation. He also appears threatened by Mari's comment about his personal life, suggesting that he might feel vulnerable or exposed. Finally, while hopefulness isn't a dominant emotion in this interaction, it could be argued that Charlie is holding out hope that they can still solve the case despite their differences.\n\nRevised scores:\nAngry: 8\nHopeful: 1\nResigned: 3\nThreatened: 5", "86": "First pass scores:\nSuperior: 8\nSympathetic: 1\nAnxious: 2\nDisappointed: 4\n\nCritique:\nIn the dialogue, Mari seems to be standing her ground against Charlie's remarks and trying to prove herself. She is confident in her abilities and not afraid to challenge Charlie's methods. However, she also shows some understanding of Charlie's situation when she mentions his drinking problem. This indicates that she might feel a bit sympathetic towards him but not enough to let him dominate the conversation.

She does not seem confused or guilty, as she stands by her principles. However, she might feel annoyed due to Sebastian's dismissive attitude towards her principles. Resigned could also be a possibility since she has encountered such attitudes before, but it is less likely than annoyed.\n\nRevised scores:\nConfused: 2\nAnnoyed: 8\nResigned: 2\nGuilty: 0", "88": "First pass scores:\nOffended: 7\nIndifferent: 2\nChallenged: 5\nInspired: 0\n\nCritique: The dialogue shows a clear difference in perspectives and values between Imogen and Sebastian.

He might feel embarrassed that she has pointed out his own flaws, especially after he was trying to point out her flaws. The anger score is low because Mike doesn't seem to be expressing anger towards Elise, but rather concern for her well-being. Indifference is not likely because Mike is engaged in the conversation and expressing his thoughts and feelings.\n\nRevised scores:\nEmbarrassment: 7\nAnger: 2\nIndifference: 0\nDefensiveness: 6", "90": "First pass scores:\nAngry: 8\nRemorseful: 0\nProud: 2\nDismissive: 7\n\nCritique: The dialogue shows a lot of tension and conflict between Imogen and Sebastian, with both characters expressing frustration and disappointment in each other's choices.

However, he is also likely to feel regret for not having told her sooner or for potentially causing tension in their friendship.
